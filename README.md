‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_ninja_challenges.py
```

The `chapters` directory contains subdirectories for each chapter in the course. Each chapter directory contains an `exercises` directory for the exercises, a `tests` directory for the tests, and a `main.py` file for testing your code.

The `ninja_challenges` directory contains additional challenges for further practice after completing the course. It also has an `exercises` directory for the challenges and a `tests` directory for the tests.

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python **3.12** or higher
- `pip` package manager
- `pytest` testing framework

To check if you have Python installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

If you get a `command not found: python`, you can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To check if you have `pip` installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip --version
```

If you get a `command not found: pip`, you can install `pip` by following the instructions on the official website: [Installing pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

To install **`pytest`**, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

This repository was last tested with `pytest` version **8.3.2**.

> Note that you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` depending on your Python installation.

---

### 2.2 Setup

First, make sure to clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmoudshaker123/The-Python-Programmer.git
```

Afterwards, navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd The-Python-Programmer/
```

---

### 2.3 Running the Exercises

1. Navigate to the chapter you are working on:

   ```bash
   cd chapters/chapter01_intro
   ```

2. Edit the `main.py` file to write your solution or test your code:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Write your solution in the corresponding exercise file. For example, if you are working on exercise 1 in chapter 1, you should write your solution in the `exercise_00.py` file.

4. Run the test to verify the correctness of your solution:

   ```bash
   pytest -k e00
   ```

   **If the test fails, you will see an error message similar to this:**

   ```bash
   tests/test_ch01.py:5: AssertionError
   =========================================== short test summary info ===========================================
   FAILED tests/test_ch01.py::test_e00 - AssertionError: assert 'I am ready to learn ______!' == 'I am ready to learn Python!'
   =========================================== 1 failed in 0.01s ===========================================
   ```

   **If the test passes, you will see a message like this:**

   ```bash
   tests/test_ch_01.py .                                                                                [100%]

   =========================================== 1 passed in 0.01s =============================================
   ```

5. If the test fails, fix the issue in your code and run the test again.

6. Repeat **steps 2-5** for each exercise in the chapter.

7. Once you have completed all the exercises in the chapter, you can move on to the next chapter and repeat the process:

   ```bash
   cd ../chapter02_variables
   ```

---

## 3. [Optional] Running the Ninja Challenges

> Problems are inspired by [EPI](https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/) book and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

1. Navigate to the ninja challenges directory:

   ```bash
   cd ninja_challenges/
   ```

2. Edit the `main.py` file to write your solution or test your code:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Run the test to verify the correctness of your solution:

   ```bash
   pytest -k challenge_01
   ```
