# This is your playground.
# Feel free to experiment with the code under `main()` block and run it as many times as you want.
# Try to run `python main.py` in the terminal from the current directory (chapter01_intro).

# You can also import functions from the exercises and use them here.
# e.g., uncomment the line below and add `print(hello_python())` to main() function.
# from exercises.exercise_00 import hello_python
