# Exercise 03 - Add Numbers
# Write a program that adds two numbers (provided as strings) and returns the sum as a string.
# For example, given the strings "123" and "456", the function should return "579".
# Hint: Can built-in functions help for type conversion?


def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    # Your code should go here.

    return ...
