## Exercise 02_04 - May The Force Be With You
# Write a program that calculates the force of gravity between two objects.
# The formula to calculate the force of gravity is:
# F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation

G = 6.674 * 10**-11  # Gravitational constant


def calculate_gravity_force(mass1, mass2, distance):
    # Your code should go here.

    return ...
