## Exercise 04_11 - Find the First Divisible by 5
# Write a program that finds the first number in a list that is divisible by 5.
# If a number is found, return it and exit the loop. If no number is found, return None.
# For example, given [12, 5, 20, 25], the function should return 5.
# or given [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], the function should return None.
