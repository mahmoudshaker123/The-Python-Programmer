# Exercise 33 - Fibonacci Sequence
# Write a function that takes a number n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
# The first few numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

# Bonus: Can you also solve this using a recursive function?


# You may need to update the function signature. See tests/test_ch5.py for inspiration.
# DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME.
