## Exercise 05_02 - Palindrome
# Write a function to check whether a string is palindrome or not

# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
# For example, "racecar" is a palindrome.
# Bonus: Can you also solve this using a recursive function?


# You may need to update the function signature. See tests/test_ch5.py for inspiration.
# DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME.
def is_palindrome():
    pass
