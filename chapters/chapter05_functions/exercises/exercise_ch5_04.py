## Exercise 05_04 - Number of 1 Bits
# Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
# For example, the 32-bit integer '11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
# Bonus: Can you also solve this using a recursive function?


# You may need to update the function signature. See tests/test_ch5.py for inspiration.
# DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME.
