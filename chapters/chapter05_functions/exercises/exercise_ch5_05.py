## Exercise 05_05 - Apply Multiple Functions
# Write a function apply_functions that takes a list of functions and a value,
# and returns a list of results by applying each function to the value.

# Example functions
# def square(x): ...
# def cube(x): ...
# print(apply_functions([square, cube], value))  # Output: [9, 27, 6]


# You may need to update the function signature. See tests/test_ch5.py for inspiration.
# DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME.
def apply_functions():
    pass
