# Exercise 44 - Sum of Frequency Tuples
# Write a function that takes a list of tuples where each tuple
# contains a name (string) and a frequency (integer) and returns a dictionary that
# contains the sum of the frequencies for each name.
# For example, the list [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 3)] should return {'a': 4, 'b': 2}.


def sum_of_freq_tuples(lst: list[tuple[str, int]]) -> dict[str, int]:
    # Your code should go here.

    return ...
