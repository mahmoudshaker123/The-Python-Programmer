# Exercise 45 - Count Words
# Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary
# where the keys are the strings and the values are the number of occurrences of each string.

# Assume all strings are lowercase.
# Hint: Try to solve this once with a built-in Python data structure and once without.


def count_words(words: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]:
    # Your code should go here.
