# Exercise 49 - Rolling Sum
# Write a function that takes a list of integers and a fixed window size N
# and returns the rolling sum of the list.
# The rolling sum is calculated by adding the elements in the window size N.

# For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the window size 3,
# the function should return [6, 9, 12].
# Hint: Is there a built-in Python data structure that can help you with this?


def rolling_sum(my_list: list[int], window_size: int) -> list[int]:
    # Your code should go here.
