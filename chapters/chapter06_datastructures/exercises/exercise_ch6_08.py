## Exercise 06_08 - Record 'X's in a Matrix
# Given a matrix of size n x m, write a function that returns the locations of all 'X's in the matrix.
# The matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each list represents a row in the matrix.
# Location is represented as a tuple with the row and column index.
# For example, given the matrix:
# [['O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
#  ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O'],
#  ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
#  ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O']]
# The function should return [(1, 1)].


def record_x_in_matrix(matrix: list[list[str]]) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:
    # Your code should go here.
