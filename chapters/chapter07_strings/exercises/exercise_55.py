# Exercise 55 - Total Sales for Specific Products

# You are given a list of strings, each representing information about daily sales transactions.
# Each line contains a date, product name, and sales amount, separated by commas.
# Write a function that takes this list of sales transactions and returns the total sales for each product.

# For example:
# sales = [
#     "2021-01-01,apple,100",
#     "2021-01-01,orange,200",
#     "2021-01-02,apple,150",
#     "2021-01-02,orange,250",
#   ]
# The function should return: [("apple", 250), ("orange", 450)]
