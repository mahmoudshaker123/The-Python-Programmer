# Exercise 57 - String Compression
# Write a function that compresses a string using a simple compression algorithm.
# If a character appears more than once in a row, replace the sequence with
# the character followed by the number of times it appears.
# For example, the string "aaabbbbbcc" would be compressed to "a3b5c2".


def compress_string(s: str) -> str:
    # Your code should go here.
