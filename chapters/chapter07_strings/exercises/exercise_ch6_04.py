# You are given a list of log entries from a server.
# Each entry is a string that contains:

# Your task is to write a function extract_error_messages that takes this list of log entries and
# returns a list of error messages (i.e., the messages associated with the log level "ERROR").


def get_substring(s: str, start: int, end: int) -> str:
    # Your code should go here.

    return ...
