# Exercise 59 - File Word Frequency
# Write a function that reads a text file, and counts the frequency of each word,
#  and returns a dictionary with the word as the key and the frequency as the value.
# For example, given the text file words.txt with the following content:
# apple orange apple banana
# The function should return {"apple": 2, "orange": 1, "banana": 1}.

# Assume that the text file contains only lowercase words separated by spaces.


def count_word_frequency(file_name: str) -> dict[str, int]:
    # Your code should go here.
