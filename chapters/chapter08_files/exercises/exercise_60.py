# Exercise 60 - Course Grades Summary
# Write a function that reads a file and returns the average grade for each course.
# Each line in the file contains the course name followed by a colon and a list of grades separated by commas.
# The result should be a list of tuples where the first element is the course name
# and the second element is the average grade.

# Example course_grades.txt:
# Math: 90, 85, 88, 92, 95
# Science: 78, 85, 88, 92, 95
# History: 88, 85, 88, 92, 95
# English: 98, 85, 88, 92, 95
# The function should return [("Math", 90.0), ("Science", 87.6), ("History", 89.6), ("English", 91.6)].
