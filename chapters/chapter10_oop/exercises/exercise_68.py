# Exercise 68 - Vector Class
# Define a `Vector3D` class with attributes x, y, and z that represent the coordinates of a vector in 3D space.
# Implement basic arithmetic operations for Vector objects.
# The operations should be:
# - Addition
# - Subtraction

# Example of the expected behavior:
# v1 = Vector(1, 2, 3)
# v2 = Vector(4, 5, 6)
# v3 = v1 + v2
# v4 = v1 - v2
from __future__ import annotations


class Vector3D:
    # Your code should go here.
