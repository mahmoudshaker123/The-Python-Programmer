# Exercise 70 - Shape and Square
# Write an abstract class called `Shape` with an abstractmethod `area`.
# Create two subclasses called `Square` and `Circle` that inherit from `Shape` and implement the `area` method.
# Modify the `Square` and `Circle` classes to accept whichever attributes are necessary to calculate the area.

# See `test_e70()` in `tests/test_ch10.py` for the expected behavior.

class Square:
