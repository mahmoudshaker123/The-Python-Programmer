# Exercise 72 - Library Management System [Part 2/3]
# In this exercise, you will implement the `BookShelf` class that will hold a collection of books.

# The `BookShelf` class should have the following methods:
# 1. `__init__(books: list[Book])`: Initialize the shelf with a list of books.
# 1. `add_book(book: Book)`: Add a book to the shelf.
# 2. `remove_book(book: Book)`: Remove a book from the shelf.
# 3. `get_books() -> List[Book]`: Return a list of all the books on the shelf.
# 4. `get_books_by_genre(genre: Genre) -> List[Book]`: Return a list of books by genre.

# Note: Feel free to define any additional methods or attributes that
# you think are necessary for the `BookShelf` class.

# See `test_e72()` in `tests/test_ch10.py` for the expected behavior.
