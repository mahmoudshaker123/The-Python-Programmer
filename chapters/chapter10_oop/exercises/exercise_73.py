# Exercise 10_06 - Library Management System [Part 3/4]
# In the previous two exercises, you defined the core classes for a library management system.
# In this exercise, you will implement the `Library` class that will hold a collection of shelves.

# The `Library` class should have the following methods:
# 1. `add_shelf(shelf: BookShelf)`: Add a shelf to the library.
# 2. `remove_shelf(shelf: BookShelf)`: Remove a shelf from the library.
# 3. `get_books() -> List[Book]`: Return a list of all the books in the library.
# 4. `is_book_in_library(book: Book) -> bool`: Return `True` if the book is in the library, otherwise `False`.


# Note: Define any additional methods or attributes that you think are necessary for the `Library` class.
class Library:
    # Add your code here.
