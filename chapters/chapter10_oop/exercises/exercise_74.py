# Exercise 74 - Banking System [Part 1/2]
# In the next three exercises, you will implement a simple banking system.
# Let's start first by defining our core classes (Card, Account, and Customer).

# Create three dataclasses called `Card`, `Account`, and `Customer`.

# The `Card` class should have the following attributes:
# 1. card_number (a string)
# 2. card_holder (a string)
# 3. expiration_date (a string)
# 4. pin (a string)

# The `Account` class should have the following attributes:
# 1. account_number (a string)
# 2. account_holder (an instance of the `Customer` class)
# 3. balance (a float)
# 4. cards (a list of `Card` instances)

# The `Customer` class should have the following attributes:
# 1. first_name (a string)
# 2. last_name (a string)
# 3. accounts (a list of `Account` instances)
# 4. cards (a list of `Card` instances)
# 5. total_balance (a float)
