## Exercise 10_03 - Shape and Square
# Write an abstract class called `Shape` with an abstractmethod `area`.
# Create two subclasses called `Square` and `Circle` that inherit from `Shape` and implement the `area` method.
# Modify the `Square` and `Circle` classes to accept whichever attributes are necessary to calculate the area.


# Example:
# square = Square(5)
# assert square.area() == 25
# circle = Circle(5)
# assert circle.area() == 78.54


class Shape:
    # Your code should go here.
    ...


class Square:
    # Your code should go here.
    ...


class Circle:
    # Your code should go here.
    ...
