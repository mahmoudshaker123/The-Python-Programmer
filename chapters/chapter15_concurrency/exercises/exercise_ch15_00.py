# Exercise 15_00 - Threaded Matrix Addition
# Write a function that adds two matrices together using threads. The function should take two matrices as input and return the sum of the two matrices. The matrices will be represented as a list of lists. The function should use threads to add the matrices together. The function should return the sum of the two matrices. The matrices will be the same size and will only contain integers. The function should be named add_matrices and should have the following signature:


def add_matrices(matrix1: list, matrix2: list) -> list:
    # Your code should go here.

    return ...
