# Exercise 15_01 - Matrix Addition With Threads
# Write a function called add_matrices that takes two matrices as arguments and returns the sum of the two matrices.
# Assume that the matrices are of size 3x3 and are represented as a list of lists.
# Spin up a new thread for each row in the matrix to calculate the sum of the two matrices.
# Use the threading module to accomplish this task.


def add_matrices(matrix1: list[list[int]], matrix2: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    # Your code should go here.

    return ...
