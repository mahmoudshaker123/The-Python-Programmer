## Challenge 1 - Image Blurrer
# Write a program that takes an image as a list of lists and blurs the image. The image is represented as a list of lists, where each list represents a row of the image. Each row will contain only 0s and 1s, where 0 represents a white pixel and 1 represents a black pixel. The program should blur the image by changing each white pixel to a black pixel if any of the pixels in the 3x3 grid around it are black. The program should return the blurred image as a list of lists.


def blur_image(image: list) -> list:
    # Your code should go here.

    return ...
