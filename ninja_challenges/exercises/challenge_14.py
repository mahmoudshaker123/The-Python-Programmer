# Challenge 14 - Add Two Matrices
# Write a function add_matrices that takes two matrices and returns a new matrix that is the sum of the two matrices.
# The matrices are represented as a list of lists where each list represents a row in the matrix.
# The matrices are guaranteed to have the same dimensions.
